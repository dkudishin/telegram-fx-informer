# telegram-fx-informer
A somewhat more useful application compared to the previous one, https://github.com/dkudishin/simpletasklist

It was also created as an example to support Spring programming lessons, and while this is again a small sample project, 
it actually displays features that are closer to real life and may be considered more interesting:
* Telegram Bot API usage
* Calling REST endpoints with Spring's RestTemplate
* Parsing JSON objects and extracting data
* Persisting the data via Spring's JPA Repositories (purely to demontrate another option on top of the previous two already used in "simpletasklist")
